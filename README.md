# bls-go

**bls-go** is a Go interface for the public API provided by the United States
[Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/).

## Requirements

- [Go](https://golang.org)
- BLS.gov API key (not strictly required, but highly recommended; you can
    request one [here](https://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/))

## Installation

Build and install the program with `go install github.com/clpo13/bls-go`. This
will install the main bls-go library. See the Usage section for how to interact
with the library.

Eventually, you'll be able to call `go get github.com/clpo13/bls-go` to install
it and use `import "github.com/clpo13/bls-go"` in your own Go projects.

## Usage

Coming soon.
